USAGE INSTRUCTIONS: 

.\script_for_download_mg_rast_files.sh
This script downloads Mg-rast files, from the IDs of array @mgm_list

.\script_for_download_mg_rast_files.sh
This script downloads SRA files, from the IDs of array @sra_list

.\taxon_profiling.sh
This script was designed to process samples from NCBI (in the SRA format) and from the MGRAST database
(fastq or fasta format, beginning with mgm + id). 
The script runs all necessary steps for quality and
uniformity filtering of samples (a shorter pipeline for MGRAST samples, but longer for SRA files), and
executes taxonomic profiling using kraken2. 
For SRA files, the script runs vdb-validate, fastq-dump, prinseq and kraken2. 
For MGRAST files, the script checks the file format, and then runs prinseq and kraken2. 
The script requires the file to be already downloaded. 
Since it requires no internet connection, it can be readily submitted to a cluster partition for analysis. 
This script requires you to have prinseq -lite (perl script without the .pl extension) and 
kraken2 (script created when installing kraken2) on your bin folder, as executable. 
It also requires that SRA Toolkit is downloaded and decompressed in your computer.
